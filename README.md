# 👋 Hi, I’m Srivatsa

Robotics Software Engineer specializing in **Localization, Mapping, and Perception**, with a strong focus on **geometry-heavy, performance‑critical systems** in C++/CUDA and Python.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **theory ↔ production**, turning math into **robust, deployable robotics systems**.

## 🔧 What I Work On

* **Localization & Mapping**
  LiDAR / camera‑based odometry, scan matching, calibration, and state estimation.

* **Classical Perception**
  Surface normals, point clouds, depth images, event cameras, and multi‑sensor fusion.

* **Deep Learning for Perception**
Training and evaluating neural networks for optical flow, event-based odometry, and vision tasks using PyTorch.

* **High‑Performance Systems**
  CUDA kernels, memory‑efficient pipelines, Eigen, Ceres, PyTorch / Torch‑TensorRT.

* **Datasets & Evaluation**
  Large‑scale dataset generation, validation, benchmarking, and tooling.
